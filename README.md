Slides for [this](http://functional-perl.org/london.pm-talk/) talk.

This is based on a modified set of part of the files that the `s5`
presentation system generates, but generates the html file from Scheme
code instead.

Dependencies:

 - the Gambit Scheme system

 - `git clone https://github.com/pflanze/chj-schemelib.git lib`
   (actually, right now it needs some changes I haven't pushed there yet)

 - perltidy

But this repository contains all(?) the versions of the generated html
file, too, so you don't need to run the above to track the changes.
